Picks theorem
Given a certain lattice polygon with non-zero area.

We denote its area by S, the number of points with integer coordinates lying strictly inside the polygon by I and the number of points lying on polygon sides by B.

Then, the Pick's formula states:

S=I+B/2âˆ’1


Burnsides Lemma
Let G be the finite group of operations we can perform on X
The number of orbits of X is the average of the number of fixed points for each g in G
G must be closed
